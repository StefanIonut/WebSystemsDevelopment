<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Software applications have a very important role in the travel industry today, research showing that in the last four years, travel software has been the fastest growing application category in terms of time spent using them, increasing it with 77%.The goal is to create an application that will cater to the needs of travelers through its specifically designed functionalities and it will help guide them throughout their journey, with an accent on web service oriented architecture. This article describes how our solution serves our goal, the interaction with the user, its design and sources of information.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The backpackers travel a lot through foreign countries. They often get lost or do not know how to get around in an unfamiliar place and/or culture. We&rsquo;ve designed a smart application (to be used on Web, mobile and wearable devices) helping these backpackers crossing or exploring a foreign country. This application will provide support for actions like finding a tourist information point, shopping, finding financial help, boarding &amp; lodging, what to visit/attend, contacting local hospitals or authorities.The system will also keep track of the user health status and trip progress.</p>
<h3>Application design</h3>
<p>We considered the application design to be an important stage when building it, and taking into consideration the main aspects: interface design, usability, content and graphic design. Ui is clean, boasts an efficient layout and simplified navigation, with intuitive page titles that encompass the traveler&rsquo;s needs. The theme is &ldquo;Tafri Travel&rdquo;, one that combines beautiful, eye catching and modern elements to display to the user the functionalities of a tourist guide application. The main present colors that can be seen on the site are green, white and blue.Green, the color of life, renewal, nature, and energy, is associated with meanings of growth, harmony, freshness, safety, and environment. Green is also traditionally associated with money, finances, which our traveler might need in its journey. As for the usability part, our application promotes learnability, as it takes little time for a user to achieve a certain degree of familiarity with the interface. The most important features are easily accessed from the main menu, guiding the person towards them. The fields that require user input have placeholder so the user do not encounter difficulties or uncertainty in finding the desired information. The content is not heavy, we concentrated on keeping the right information that are necessary for the core processes of our app: maps and markers for the most important objectives considering the user, a calendar for booking flights, a hotel booking interface, weather and related information. The number of steps to achieve these actions is low, as the features are easily accessible, large buttons for the purpose of completing a process (booking a room for example), a highlighted calendar, which can be customized with no problems.</p>
<h3>User interaction</h3>
<p>When a user first opens our application, the option to login/register will be present in the right upper menu. Upon clicking the &ldquo;Register&rdquo; page, the user will be sent to a register form, in which a username will be required, an email and a strong password. All the fields have validation rules that the user must respect. A &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button at the right lower corner is present for the user to press once the fields are filled. If the action is successful, a message will be shown in the lower section of the page. Once the user has successfully registered, they can login and fully use the functionalities of our baca application. Clicking on the &ldquo;My account&rdquo; button will take the user on a login page, in which they have to enter their username/email and associated password. If successful, the user is taken to the main page, the &ldquo;Your baca&rdquo; page. Here the user can find a Travel Map which allows users to create and manage an itinerary of their journey, A blue, suggestive button is at its center, with the text &ldquo;Create your itinerary&rdquo;. Once clicked, the button will open a map with more options for the user. They can create a TravelBlog account or sign in with their Facebook/Gmail, search for a place on the map , use geolocation, add a first spot on the map for their itinerary. Underneath it can be found a tracker for your smartphone, so you can be aware of your route, with an interactive map. On it, the user can select predefined routes or see the historical ones, delete past routes, refresh the map for accuracy of the location, view other users of the application on the map, or a more interactive satellite view. In the footer of the page, there is a widget for live weather. The widget offers information about the temperature, wind speed and direction, the chances of precipitation, pressure, and some information about the health of the user. After the main page, the user can go to the Hotel &amp; flights page, where they can immediately book a flight to another town or maybe settle in a hotel for the night. For booking a flight, the user must choose a departing town,the plugin offering name suggestions while the user is typing. After also choosing a destination date, the duration of the vacation and the currency ,the application can display the lowest ticket price for each month or for each day if you want so. If the user wants to find a hotel, they can check the available rooms and their prices for a certain period of time, the plugin displaying useful information such as rating, reviews, etc. At the press of a button, the user can just make a reservation, providing the number of nights the user wants to stay, the payment method and so on. Next, the user can navigate on the menu and go to the About page, where you can find information about the application, the developers and the purpose of the project. There is also the blog page, where the most relevant updates for the app are posted. The email page is provided for the user so they can be in sync and up to date with their emails wherever they go, the outlook emails more specifically. My account page is the user&rsquo;s profile page, where general information that the user has provided about themselves is present. From that page, they can logout, change passwords or edit that information.
